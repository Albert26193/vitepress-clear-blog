# Machine Learning Architectures Deep Dive

## Foundation Models

Modern ML is increasingly built on foundation models. This builds on concepts from [[ai-development|AI Development Trends]].

### Transformer Architecture

The transformer architecture has revolutionized NLP and beyond.

#### Multi-Head Attention

Key innovation enabling parallel processing of sequences.

#### Position Embeddings

Critical for maintaining sequential information.

## Specialized Architectures

### Computer Vision

For visual processing tasks, specialized architectures include:

- CNNs
- Vision Transformers

### Natural Language Processing

See our detailed guide on [Enterprise AI Implementation](enterprise-ai-guide.md) for practical applications.

## Future Architectures

### Hybrid Models

Combining different architectural paradigms for improved performance.
